///////////// TODO /////////////

[ ] Add Semantic Graph
	* Tracks modules, functions, does lookup and type checking before interpretetation
	* Can point into existing asts
[ ] Add error recovery for parser
	* Currently, any breaking error will skip error checking for the rest of the file
[?] Remove elseif in favor or else [then]
	* To better match expression ifs
[ ] Add severity levels to errors
	[ ] Change error categories from severity to area
	[ ] Map severity in a hashmap
	[ ] Add to language server
[ ] Add refererence-support to error messages
	[ ] Implement for keyword aligmnent
	[ ] Implement for block comments
	[ ] Implement for string literals
[ ] Add import statement for FFI
	* Possibly looks like a struct with fields
	* HMMM: How to deal with symbols that collide with keywords?
[ ] Symbol lookup seems to fail for the global/main scope when invoked from inner modules

///////////// DONE /////////////

[X] Change block alignment rules to require exact alignment of block start
[X] Add indentation checking for expressions
[X] Fix FatArrow in if-expressions not allowing expressions on the same line
[X] Add check for preferring horizontal block keywords if they are possible
[X] Add default construction for symbol declarations without init expressions
[X] Add struct literals
[X] Stack references are copied into function arguments instead of values
[X] Stack references cannot be passed as ref, as they do not address the frame
